# CMPT371 Final Project

This is the team repo for CMPT 371 Final Project *(Network)*.

For this project, we used multithreading with socket programming to create a minigame using python.

## Game Description

This is a territorial, tile-based multiplayer game where the objective of the game is to capture the most number of tiles on the board. 

The game requires at least two players and can support up to a maximum of four players.

### **Game Objective**

The game objective for each player is to capture the most number of white tiles on the board within the time limit of the game. In other words, the player with the highest number of captured cells wins! If a player has previously captured a tile, that tile is considered locked to that
player's colour.
